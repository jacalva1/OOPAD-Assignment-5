# CIDM 4360/5360 Assignment #5:  Coding Classes relationships
## <p style color="red">Due:  Fri Dec 6, 11:59pm</p> 
Objective: Assess your understanding of Class diagrams, and implementing relationships between classes in C#. 
Skills needed: given a Class Diagram,  you'll need to Know how to: 
1. How to read the class diagram  
2. Implement the classes in C#   
    a. Define the class   
    b. Define the attributes with appropriate access levels   
    c. Define the methods with appropriate access levels   
    d. Create new Class from base class using Inheritance   
    e. Declare abstract class, and abstract methods   
    f. Override base class virtual and abstract methods   
 
3. Identify the relationships, their types,  and their multiplicities   
4. Implement the relationships in the each participating class according to its type and multiplicity    
~~5. [CIDM5360] Create object diagram form a given code~~  
 
Requirements & Submission: 
1. You need to submit complete, clean, error-free and runnable C# code (zip the whole folder of your code) 
2. You must add the names of the group members and the course code (CIDM4360 or CIDM5360) to the beginning of each source code file 
3. Submit your compressed file using the link in  WTClass (“Resources >> Assignments >> Assignment#5)  
 
 
Rules and conditions: Your code should comply with the following rules: 
1. Don’t change the given code, i.e. should work with the given code as is. I’m going to replace the main program class in your submission with the code provided, and if your code didn’t work you will miss points. 
2. Must implement only the classes in the given class diagram (don’t add any extra classes) 
3. Must implement the needed constructor(s), and call the base class constructors when needed. 
4. Do not add attributes form other classes inside any of the classes  
5. Do not add any new attributes to any of the classes except those you need to setup the relationships with other classes.  
6- Must implement all the attributes and methods with the correct access levels (using visibility symbols in the class diagram)   
7. Must implement the relationships correctly based on their types and multiplicities   
    -  Note that the class diagram doesn’t show the attributes needed to setup the relationships between the classes. 
8. No Data inputs is needed from the console. The main program has everything you need   
 
Description: 
Using the following class diagram, which has five classes `“Bill”,”Payment”, ”Cash” , ”CreditCard” and “Check”`,  and using the main program  C# code  that uses these classes ( attached with this assignment in WTClass),  complete the code by implementing these five classes and their relationships to accomplish the functionalities in the  main program
